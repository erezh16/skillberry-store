##@ Container environment

# Application env vars baked into the image, from $(CONTAINER_ENV_FILE).
#
# The service picks them up because tools/configure.py calls python-dotenv's
# load_dotenv() at import time, and its search walks up from the package
# directory to /app/.env. That places the values in os.environ before any
# setting is read, so they are set under a plain `docker run <image>`, under a
# k8s/OpenShift `command:` override, and without going through `make run` --
# none of which is true of a value exported by a makefile.
#
# load_dotenv() does not override an already-set variable, so `docker run -e`,
# `--env-file` and a k8s `env:` entry still win, exactly as they do over a
# Dockerfile ENV. The file is a source of deployment *defaults*, not an
# override, and it must hold no secrets: it is baked into the image.
#
# The image cannot just carry the repo's own .env -- that name is in
# .dockerignore (and .gitignore), so it never enters the build context. Hence a
# separate, version-controlled file copied to /app/.env via the EXTRA_COPY_FILES
# hook, which also grants gid 0 the owner's access -- what makes the file
# readable under the arbitrary UID OpenShift assigns.

# than break every image build.

# itself a documented user-facing knob: a plain assignment here would be
# silently discarded by `make docker-build EXTRA_COPY_FILES=<pair>` -- and the
# env file would then vanish from the image just because the caller also asked
# to copy something else.
