# Overall Configuration Variable Overrides

This table lists the default ports, host URLs and overall service configuration used by SBS service, along with the environment variables that can be used to override them.

| Configuration            | Default value | Environment Variables Override   | Notes
|--------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| FastAPI Service host     | "0.0.0.0"     | `SBS_HOST`                       |                                                             |
| FastAPI Service port     | 8000          | `SBS_PORT`                       |                                                             |
| UI port (legacy subprocess) | 8002       | `SBS_UI_PORT`                    | Only the legacy `ENABLE_UI_SUBPROCESS=true` mode, which spawns `vite preview`. The UI is normally served by the backend itself at `/ui` on `SBS_PORT` |
| Vite dev server port     | 8002          | `VITE_UI_PORT`                   | `make ui-dev` only (hot-reloading dev server, proxies API calls to `SBS_PORT`)  |
| Prometheus metric port   | 8090          | `PROMETHEUS_METRICS_PORT`        | SBS prometheus endpoint (used for scraping metrics)         |
| Open telemetric port     | None          | `OTEL_TRACES_PORT`               | Must be set for OpenTelemetry tracing to work               |
| Observability enablement | True          | `OBSERVABILITY`                  | If False - disable observability (telemetry and prometheus) |
| Python execution mode    | False         | `EXECUTE_PYTHON_LOCALLY`         | If True - use local exec() instead of Docker                |
| Auto-detect dependencies | True          | `AUTO_DETECT_TOOL_DEPENDENCIES`  | If False - disable automatic tool dependency detection      |
| Public base URL          | None          | `SBS_PUBLIC_URL`                 | The externally-visible base URL — the one a user's terminal can reach. Not derivable from the bind address: behind an ingress or load balancer, forwarded headers are ignored (uvicorn is started without `forwarded_allow_ips`) and the server would otherwise report its internal address. Required for the `npx skills add` install command, which is absolute; without it the command is omitted rather than guessed. Must carry an `http://` or `https://` scheme, and a trailing slash is normalised away. Useful beyond npx — it is the value any copy-paste snippet needs |

> You can override the default values by setting the corresponding environment variables in your deployment configuration.


This table lists the native CLI distribution configuration — how a running store
prepares and serves the `sbs` binary (see [the CLI guide](cli.md) and
[docs/design/new_cli.md](design/new_cli.md)).

| Configuration | Default value | Environment Variables Override | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| CLI downloads | `on` | `SBS_CLI_DOWNLOAD` | `off` **unregisters the `/cli/*` endpoints entirely** — they become plain 404s and appear in no route table or OpenAPI schema, rather than existing and refusing. This is the rollback switch for the whole feature |
| Artifact preparation | `auto` | `SBS_CLI_PREPARE` | `auto` prepares at startup, skipping any platform whose stamp still matches; `always` forces re-preparation; `never` serves only what is already in the dist directory. Preparation is a background task — `/health/ready` never waits for it |
| URL injection mechanism | `patch` | `SBS_CLI_BUILD_MODE` | `patch` rewrites a fixed-width URL slot inside a CI-built binary in place (milliseconds, **no Go toolchain needed** — the default for that reason). `rebuild` cross-compiles with the URL baked via `-ldflags`, which needs a toolchain and is the only mechanism that covers `darwin-arm64`. `auto` uses `rebuild` where a toolchain exists |
| Prepared artifact directory | `{SBS_BASE_DIR}/cli-dist` | `SBS_CLI_DIST_DIR` | Prepared artifacts plus `manifest.json`. **A cache, not state** — an ephemeral directory costs one background re-preparation on cold start. Point it at a volume to avoid that |
| CI artifact directory | `/app/cli-prebuilt` | `SBS_CLI_ARTIFACTS_DIR` | Where the cross-compiled binaries live, baked into the image or mounted. Accepts either `<dir>/<platform>/sbs` (what `make cli-dist` emits) or a flat `<dir>/sbs-<platform>`. Absent ⇒ every platform reports `not_bundled`, truthfully |
| Lazy artifact fetch | *(unset)* | `SBS_CLI_ARTIFACTS_URL` | Base URL for sha256-pinned fetching of platforms missing from the image, so a release image need not carry ~160 MB of binaries |
| Download concurrency cap | `8` | `SBS_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT_DOWNLOADS` | Crude in-process backpressure on an unauthenticated ~32 MB GET. Honestly per-replica; let an ingress or CDN cache `/cli/*` for real protection |

`SBS_PUBLIC_URL` (above) is what gets **baked into the downloaded binaries**, so
a user who downloads the CLI from your store gets one that talks to your store
with no configuration. Without it, artifacts are served pristine — they carry
their compile-time default and a user needs `sbs connect <url>` — and the boot log
says so. The install scripts fall back to the request's own `Host`, which is safe
only because a generated script is consumed immediately by the client that asked
for it; a shared artifact never uses a client-supplied value.

These two are read by the **CLI on the user's machine**, not by the store:

| Configuration | Default value | Environment Variables Override | Notes |
|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Store URL override | *(the baked-in URL)* | `SBS_URL` | Points `sbs` at a different store for one invocation. Precedence: `sbs connect` (user config) → `SBS_URL` → the baked-in URL |
| Bearer token | *(unset)* | `SBS_TOKEN` | A token for CI/scripting instead of an interactive prompt. Select it with `sbs -p env-token <command>`. The token stays in the environment and never appears on the command line |

> **The `/cli/*` endpoints are unauthenticated in every access-control mode.** That
> is enforced by a mandatory floor in the config loader, not by the
> `unauthenticated_paths` list, so an operator's own list cannot close them — a
> browser, `curl`, CI or a freshly downloaded binary has no token to offer, and a
> user who cannot sign in yet is exactly the user who needs the CLI. The surface
> serves no tenant data, no configuration and no login message, and accepts no
> request body. Anything the floor has to add that your config file omits is named
> in the boot log. To remove the surface entirely, use `SBS_CLI_DOWNLOAD=off`.


This table lists the `npx skills add` publishing configuration (see
[the npx section of the CLI guide](cli.md#install-skills-into-your-agent-with-npx)
and [docs/design/npx.md](design/npx.md)).

| Configuration          | Default value                          | Environment Variables Override | Notes |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| npx publishing | `selective`                            | *(none — `npx_publish` in `access_control_config.yaml`)* | Deliberately **not** an environment variable: it is the one setting that makes skill **content**, not just metadata, readable without a session, so it is declared beside `unauthenticated_paths` where the rest of the access-control posture is reviewed. Three values, independent of the ACL `mode`: `true` (all skills), `false` (none — the `/pub/*` routes are not registered at all), `selective` (each skill's own `npx_publish` flag decides; unset means not published). A junk value fails closed to `false` |
| Publish seed           | generated on first use                 | `SBS_PUBLISH_SEED`             | The value each per-skill install URL is derived from. Set it to keep install URLs stable across deployments and restarts; **rotating it is the global revoke**, after which everyone re-copies their command. **Confidential** — see the note below |
| Publish seed file      | `~/.skillberry/publish_seed.json`      | `SBS_PUBLISH_SEED_FILE`        | Where a generated seed is persisted (atomic write, mode 0600) so the next boot reuses it. Ignored when `SBS_PUBLISH_SEED` is set |
| Publishable namespaces | *(unset — any namespace)*              | `SBS_PUBLISH_NAMESPACES`       | Comma-separated allowlist restricting which namespaces a namespace-scoped install URL may name. Per-skill URLs are unaffected. An empty value is treated as unset, not as "none" |

> **Handle the publish seed as confidential.** Its name is deliberately plain —
> repository scanners match on `secret`/`key`/`token` identifiers — but an install
> URL is `HMAC(seed, "tenant|scope")`, so anyone who can read the seed can derive
> a working URL for any tenant and any skill **offline, with no authentication**.
> Tenant ids are in the access-control config and slugs come from skill names, so
> the seed is the only thing making a URL unguessable. Do not commit it, log it,
> or bake it into an image; pass it at run time.


> **Telemetry.** `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` (or `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`) is read by the **npx
> CLI on the user's machine**, not by the store — SBS cannot set or enforce it,
> and the install command it emits deliberately carries no such prefix. Export it
> in the shell profile or CI environment your users' shells inherit; that covers
> every `npx skills add` and `npx skills update` rather than one invocation. See
> [the npx section of the CLI guide](cli.md#telemetry-and-how-to-opt-out) for what
> is reported.

This table lists embedding configuration used by SBS service, along with the environment variables that can be used to override them.

| Configuration     | Default value                                   | Environment Variables Override | Notes |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| Vector database   | "faiss"                                         | `SBS_VDB`                      |       |
| Model dimension   | 384                                             | `EMBEDDING_MODEL_DIMENSION`    |       |

| Model cache dir   | `$APP_HOME/.cache/fastembed` in the container, else `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/fastembed` or `~/.cache/fastembed` | `SBS_ENCODER_CACHE_DIR` | Where the ~80 MB ONNX encoder weights are cached. The image ships them pre-seeded so startup needs no HuggingFace access; fastembed ignores `HF_HOME` / `TRANSFORMERS_CACHE` / `XDG_CACHE_HOME`, so this is the only knob |
| Max sequence length | 256                                           | `SBS_ENCODER_MAX_LENGTH`       | Tokens before input is truncated. 256 matches `SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')`, so vectors stay comparable with indices built before the fastembed migration. Override only to match an index already built at a different limit (fastembed's own default for these weights is 128) |

This table lists MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration used by SBS service, along with the environment variables that can be used to override them.

This table lists test configuration used by SBS service, along with the environment variables that can be used to override them.

| Configuration   | Default value | Environment Variables Override | Notes                                    |
|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Test debug mode | False         | `SBS_TEST_DEBUG`               | If True - enable debug logging for tests |

> You can override the default values by setting the corresponding environment variables in your deployment configuration.

### Example: Running tests with debug logs enabled

To enable debug logging when running tests with make:

```bash
SBS_TEST_DEBUG=true make test
```

## Skill-import authentication

Importing skills from remote sources (currently GitHub) can require auth. This
is the **only** thing configured via a file — everything else uses env vars.

The file uses the same shape as `gh`'s `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`: a mapping keyed
by hostname.

| Configuration | Default value             | Environment Variable Override | Notes                                              |
|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Import auth   | `./import_auth_config.yaml` | `SBS_IMPORT_AUTH_CONFIG`    | Loaded once at startup; missing/empty => anonymous |

```yaml
github.com:
  user: eranra
  oauth_token: gho_xxxxxxxx
  git_protocol: https
```

By default imports are **anonymous** (public sources need no config). For a
non-anonymous import, the host matching the fetched URL is resolved in order:

1. `oauth_token` — sent as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
2. `login_url` — forced re-auth: the API returns `401` + this URL; the user logs
   in to get a token, then retries sending header `X-Endpoint-Token: <token>`.
3. Neither — fall back to the `gh` CLI token in `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`, if
   present (when `gh` stores it in the OS keyring it is not in the file, so this
   falls through to anonymous).

## Setting these variables in a container

Every variable in the tables above can be given a value that is **baked into the
image**, so it is set under a plain `docker run <image>` with no `--env-file`
flag, no `make` in the loop, and no Dockerfile edit.

Put it in [`container.env`](../container.env) at the repo root:

```sh
# container.env
SBS_BASE_DIR=/app/store-data
SBS_VDB=faiss
OBSERVABILITY=false
```

Then build and run normally:

```sh
make docker-build
docker run -d --network=host ghcr.io/skillberry-ai/skillberry-store:latest
```

`make docker-build` copies the file to `/app/.env` inside the image (through the
`EXTRA_COPY_FILES` hook — any pair you pass on the command line is kept as
well), and the service loads it at startup with python-dotenv. Build against a
different file with `make docker-build CONTAINER_ENV_FILE=prod.env`; if the file
is absent the build simply skips it.

### Precedence

Highest wins:

1. `docker run -e VAR=…` / `docker run --env-file …`, and Kubernetes `env:` /
   `envFrom:` — per-deployment overrides.
2. The image's own Dockerfile `ENV` (`APP_HOME`, `APP_DATA_DIR`, …).
3. `container.env`, baked to `/app/.env` — deployment defaults.
4. The default in the tables above, compiled into the code.

So `container.env` behaves like a Dockerfile `ENV` would: it supplies a default
and never fights a value the deployment sets explicitly. `make docker-run`
additionally passes the host's own (git-ignored) `.env` with `--env-file`, which
therefore overrides `container.env` — use the host `.env` for local, throwaway
values and `container.env` for what should ship with the image.

> **Never put secrets in `container.env`.** The values ride inside the image, so
> anyone who can pull it can read them. Pass secrets at run time: `-e`, or a k8s
> Secret via `envFrom:`.

### Kubernetes and OpenShift

Both are supported with no extra work:

- **`env:` / `envFrom:` still override**, per the precedence above, so a
  ConfigMap or Secret behaves exactly as it would against a Dockerfile `ENV`.
- **Arbitrary UIDs (OpenShift) work.** The file is staged with the group given
  the owner's access and lands under `$APP_HOME`, which the image `chgrp 0`s and
  `chmod g=u`s — so the random UID OpenShift assigns (always in gid 0) can read
  it. Verified by running the image as `--user 1000670000:0`.
- **A `command:` override still gets the variables**, because the loading
  happens inside the application rather than in an entrypoint script — unlike an
  `ENTRYPOINT` wrapper, which `command:` replaces.
- **`readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` is fine** — the file is only ever read.

Two limits worth knowing: the variables reach the *application* process (and
anything it spawns), so an interactive `docker exec … sh` will not see them; and
a variable consumed at Python *import* time by a module imported before
`skillberry_store.tools.configure` would miss them. Use a Dockerfile `ENV` for
either case.
