"""End-to-end assertions on a *built* native CLI binary.

docs/design/new_cli.md §8.1 #6, §8.2 #12 and §8.3 #19. These are the tests that
cannot be written in Go: they need a real linked binary and a running store, and
what they assert is the thing users actually see — the help text restish renders
and the exit status the process returns.

Every test skips without a Go toolchain. A `pip`-only contributor must be able to
run `make test`; building the CLI is a release-time concern (§G10).

Three properties are pinned here:

1. **The branded surface.** Root usage says ``sbs``, operations are at the root,
   and the word "restish" appears nowhere outside the four known strings of
   §3.3. This is the regression gate for Feature A, on the real binary.
2. **Zero configuration.** ``sbs list-skills`` against the store returns data
   from a clean ``HOME`` with no config file and no ``connect`` — measurement M2
   turned into a test, and the whole promise of a downloaded artifact.
3. **The ``-ldflags`` control.** A binary linked against a dead port must
   *fail*. ``-X`` silently no-ops unless the target has a constant string
   initializer (§3.4 #1, G8): during prototyping the happy path looked correct
   while the flag was being ignored entirely, and only a build that *should*
   fail revealed it. Without this test, "the URL was baked in" is unverified.
