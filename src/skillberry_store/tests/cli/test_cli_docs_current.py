"""The CLI docs describe the native download, not a manual restish install.

docs/design/new_cli.md §8.3 #22, in the style of ``test_ui_docs_current.py``.

Docs rot silently, and these particular docs rot into a *dead end*: they used to
tell users to `go install github.com/rest-sh/restish@latest` before `sbs` would
work at all. That instruction now describes a prerequisite that does not exist,
and a user following it would install an unrelated binary and still not have
`sbs`. §9.1 makes updating them part of the change rather than follow-up
paperwork, and this is what enforces that.

The assertions are about *user-actionable content* — the install command, the
breaking change, the platform list — not prose, so ordinary editing does not
break them.
