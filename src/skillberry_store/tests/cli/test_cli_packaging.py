"""The `skillberry-store-cli` distribution and the SDK's `[cli]` extra.

docs/design/new_cli.md §4.6 and G5: a Go binary cannot be a `pip` console
script, so the CLI is distributed as platform wheels carrying the binary plus a
launcher. This is the structural guard on that arrangement — the bits that, if
they drift, produce a package that installs cleanly and then does not work.

The functional check (build a wheel, install it, run `sbs`) lives in CI, where
the artifacts exist; here everything is read off disk so the tests run in any
checkout.
