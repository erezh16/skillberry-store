"""The reserved-name guard for the native CLI's promoted command surface.

docs/design/new_cli.md §8.1 #5. The Go CLI embeds restish with
``SetCommandSurface{PromotedAPI: "store", SupportCommandNamespace: "cli"}``, so
every generated operation lands at the *root* of the command tree — ``sbs
list-skills``, not ``sbs store list-skills`` (§4.2).

That is the whole ergonomic point, and it creates one failure mode worth a test:
if an endpoint's ``x-cli-name`` ever equals the support namespace, restish
refuses to start with

    command surface: promoted operation "cli" collides with support command
    namespace "cli"; choose another SupportCommandNamespace or hide support
    commands

which is a *runtime* failure of the shipped binary, triggered by an endpoint
added on the Python side. This test moves that discovery to PR time, where the
person who added the endpoint can see it, rather than to release time — or to a
user's terminal.

The same applies to the verbs the CLI handles itself before restish parses argv
(``connect``, ``download-cli``, ``self-update``): an operation with one of those
names would be silently shadowed, which is worse than a collision error because
nothing would report it at all.
