"""The generated SDK is a pure Python library and ships no ``sbs`` command.

docs/design/new_cli.md §8.3 #21c — the regression test for the deletion in §4.6.

There is now exactly one implementation of ``sbs``: the native Go binary in
``cli/go`` that embeds restish as a library. The Python shim that used to be
injected into the generated SDK is gone, and it is not coming back as a
fallback — its subprocess model is precisely what made the CLI's output
impossible to brand (§10).

This is also the guard on the one **breaking change** the design accepts (G7,
§9.1): ``pip install skillberry-store-sdk`` no longer provides ``sbs``. The
remedy is in the CHANGELOG under the identifier ``sbs console script``, and
``test_changelog.py`` keeps that note findable.

The SDK itself must stay pure Python and universal — it is a library and has to
install anywhere, including platforms with no CLI wheel — so what is asserted
here is the *absence* of a console script, not the presence of a binary.
