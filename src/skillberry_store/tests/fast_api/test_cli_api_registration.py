"""The /cli/* surface on the real ``SBS`` app.

docs/design/new_cli.md §8.2 #15, #17 and §5.5.4. ``test_cli_api.py`` covers the
routes' own behaviour on a minimal app; these assertions need the whole thing,
because what they check is how the CLI surface interacts with the store's global
machinery:

* the **RBAC coverage audit**, which fails startup for any route lacking a
  ``@requires`` marker unless it is allow-listed — so constructing ``SBS`` at all
  is the assertion that these routes are correctly treated as public;
* the **curated MCP surface**, which must not gain a 32 MB octet-stream tool;
* **readiness**, which must not wait for artifact preparation;
* the ``Accept-CH`` advertisement on ``/ui``, without which the download modal
  cannot tell an Apple Silicon Mac from an Intel one.
