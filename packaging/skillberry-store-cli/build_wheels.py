"""Build one `skillberry-store-cli` wheel per platform.

docs/design/new_cli.md §4.6 / G5. Reads the artifacts produced by
``cli/build.sh`` and emits a platform-tagged wheel for each, so that
``pip install skillberry-store-cli`` resolves to the right binary automatically.

Usage::

    python packaging/skillberry-store-cli/build_wheels.py \
        --artifacts cli-prebuilt --out dist

Why this is a script rather than a `cibuildwheel` config: there is nothing to
*compile* per platform. The binaries already exist (cross-compiled from one
Linux host), so all that is needed is to drop each one into the package and tag
the wheel. Driving cibuildwheel would mean five native runners to do no
compilation, which is the cost the Go pivot removed in the first place.
