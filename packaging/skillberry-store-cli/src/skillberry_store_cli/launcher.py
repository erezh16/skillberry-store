"""Hand the process over to the bundled `sbs` binary.

Three lines of real work, and one deliberate choice: on POSIX this ``execv``s
rather than spawning a subprocess, so the binary *replaces* this process. That
matters for a CLI:

* signals (Ctrl-C, SIGTERM) reach the program the user is actually running,
  rather than a Python parent that may or may not forward them;
* the exit status is the binary's own, with no translation layer to get wrong;
* there is no extra process in ``ps``, no doubled memory, and no risk of an
  orphan if the parent is killed;
* the TTY belongs to the binary, so colour, progress and interactive prompts
  behave exactly as they do for a directly-installed binary.

Windows has no ``execv`` that replaces the image in a usable way (its emulation
returns immediately and detaches, which breaks piping and exit codes), so there
the binary is spawned and its status is propagated.
