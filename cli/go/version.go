package main

// Build-time injected values and the padded URL slot.
//
// Both mechanisms in docs/design/new_cli.md §5.2 write to the variables in this
// file: `rebuild` passes `-ldflags -X main.urlSlot=<url>`, and `patch` rewrites
// the slot's bytes in place inside an already-linked artifact.
//
// GOTCHA (§3.4 #1, G8): `-ldflags -X` silently no-ops unless the target
// variable is a package-level string with a *constant* initializer. The first
// prototype used `"…" + strings.Repeat("#", 0)` and the flag was ignored —
// the binary kept its source default and nothing failed loudly. So:
//
//   - every value here MUST be a plain string literal, never an expression;
//   - `TestURLSlotIsPatchable` asserts the slot keeps its padded shape, and
//     the build script's control case (a binary linked against a dead port
//     that must FAIL) is what actually proves the flag took effect.
//
// Do not "tidy" these into a const block: `-X` cannot write to a const.

// urlSlot is the compiled-in store URL, padded to slotWidth with '#' so the
// `patch` mechanism can rewrite it in place without changing the file size.
//
// The padding is what makes patching possible at all: a linked binary has no
// room to grow a string, but overwriting slotWidth bytes and re-trimming the
// padding at runtime costs zero bytes. See dist/patch.py for the writer.
var urlSlot = "http://localhost:8000#######################################"

// version is the CLI version, injected at build time by `-ldflags -X`.
// "dev" is what a plain `go build` reports, which is the honest answer for a
// developer's own build.
var version = "dev"

// engineVersion records which restish the artifact embeds. It is part of the
// preparation stamp key (§5.3), so it is injected rather than inferred: the
// server has to know what it is serving without executing it.
var engineVersion = "unknown"

// slotWidth is the exact byte length of urlSlot's initializer above. The
// `patch` mechanism refuses to write a URL longer than this, and refuses to
// write one that would change the file size — both checked against this
// constant on the Go side and against the located slot on the Python side.
const slotWidth = 60

// slotPad is the padding byte. Chosen as '#' because it cannot appear in a URL
// that passes the §5.7 validator, so trimming it can never truncate a real URL.
const slotPad = '#'
