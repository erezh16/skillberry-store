// Package cli implements the Skillberry Store CLI, `sbs`.
//
// It embeds restish (https://rest.sh) as a Go *library* rather than shelling out
// to it, which is what lets every usage line, error and hint say "sbs". See
// docs/design/new_cli.md — §3 for why the subprocess shim was replaced, §4 for
// the branding layer this file holds.
//
// The whole of the branding is the ~30 lines in Run(): a command name, a
// description, a default config, a command surface and an auth handler. There is
// deliberately no output rewriting anywhere in this package; the superseded
// design's ~150-line scrubber is the thing this approach exists to not write
// (§10).
//
// # Why this is a library and not a main package
//
// The binary is `cli/cmd/sbs`, which is ~20 lines calling Run. Everything else
// lives here, as an importable package, because Go refuses to import a
// `package main` ("a program, not an importable package") — so the test suite in
// client/go/tests can only exist if the implementation is a library.
//
// That is also why the identifiers the tests exercise are exported. This package
// has exactly one intended consumer (cmd/sbs) plus its tests; the exported
// surface is a consequence of the repository layout, not an API promise to
// outside callers.

%[1]s is the command-line interface to a Skillberry Store.

Operations are generated from the store's own OpenAPI spec, so the commands
available always match the store you are pointed at:

  %[1]s list-skills                 List the skills in the store
  %[1]s get-skill <uuid>            Fetch one skill
  %[1]s list-tools                  List the tools in the store

Pointing at a store:

  %[1]s connect <url>               Remember a store URL (writes your config)
  %[2]s=<url> %[1]s list-skills        Override the URL for one command

Authentication happens on demand: any command prompts when the store requires
it, and the token is cached, so there is no separate setup step. %[3]s
pre-authenticates and %[4]s drops the cached token.

  %[5]s=<token> %[1]s list-skills      Use a token instead of prompting (CI)

Getting the CLI onto another machine:

  %[1]s download-cli                Download the artifact for any platform
  %[1]s self-update                 Replace this binary with the store's build

Configuration, diagnostics and cache management live under "%[1]s %[6]s":

  %[1]s %[6]s doctor                     Show resolved URLs, paths and spec freshness
  %[1]s %[6]s config path                Print the config file path
  %[1]s %[6]s cache clear                Drop the cached OpenAPI spec
