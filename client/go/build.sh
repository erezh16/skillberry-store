# manifest of what was built.
#
# This is the CI step of docs/design/new_cli.md §5.10 #1 and the `rebuild`
# mechanism of §5.2. Because Go cross-compiles with CGO_ENABLED=0, ONE Linux
# runner produces all five artifacts (M4); no per-OS runner is needed to build
# them, only to execute them.
#
# Usage:
#   client/go/build.sh [--out DIR] [--url URL] [--version V] [--platforms "a b c"]
#
# The emitted prebuilt-manifest.json is what the server's artifact service reads
# to learn each artifact's sha256 and slot offsets without executing it.
